This directory contains a selection of radio configuiration files for use by RH_RF24.cpp
They were generated by Silicon Labs Wireless Development Suite (WDS) 3.2.11.0
The configuration file controls all the basic frequency aand modulation parameters for the radio.
The appropriate one for your application or sketch must be #included by RH_RF24.cpp

You can generate your own custom configuration file by generatng a new one with WDS,
copying it to this directory with a unique anme and #include it in RH_RF24.cpp

The file names encode the basic parameters:

radio_config_Siaaaa_bb_ccc_dddd_ee_ff_gg.h

where
aaaa = Chip typenukber eg 4464
bb   = Crytsyal frequency in MHz
ccc  = RF base frequency in MHz
dddd = Modulation type eg 2GFSK
ee   = Data rate in kbps
ff   = Deviation in kHz
