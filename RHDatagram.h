/// \class RHDatagram RHDatagram.h <RHDatagram.h>
/// \brief Manager class for addressed, unreliable messages
///
/// Every RHDatagram node has an 8 bit address (defaults to 0).
/// Addresses (DEST and SRC) are 8 bit integers with an address of RH_BROADCAST_ADDRESS (0xff) 
/// reserved for broadcast.
///
/// \par Media Access Strategy
///
/// RHDatagram and the underlying drivers always transmit as soon as sendto() is called.
///
/// \par Message Lengths
///
/// Not all Radio drivers supported by RadioHead can handle the same message lengths. Some radios can handle
/// up to 255 octets, and some as few as 28. If you attempt to send a message that is too long for 
/// the underlying driver, sendTo() will return false and will not transmit the message. 
/// It is the programmers responsibility to make
/// sure that messages passed to sendto() do not exceed the capability of the radio. You can use the 
/// *_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH definitions or driver->maxMessageLength() to help.
///
/// \par Headers
///
/// Each message sent and received by a RadioHead driver includes 4 headers:<br>
/// \b TO The node address that the message is being sent to (broadcast RH_BROADCAST_ADDRESS (255) is permitted)<br>
/// \b FROM The node address of the sending node<br>
/// \b ID A message ID, distinct (over short time scales) for each message sent by a particilar node<br>
/// \b FLAGS A bitmask of flags. The most significant 4 bits are reserved for use by RadioHead. The least
/// significant 4 bits are reserved for applications.<br>
