/// \class RHEncryptedDriver RHEncryptedDriver <RHEncryptedDriver.h>
/// \brief Virtual Driver to encrypt/decrypt data. Can be used with any other RadioHead driver.
///
/// This driver acts as a wrapper for any other RadioHead driver, adding encryption and decryption of
/// messages that are passed to and from the actual radio driver. Any of the encryption ciphers supported by
/// ArduinoLibs Cryptographic Library http://rweather.github.io/arduinolibs/crypto.html may be used.
///
/// For successful communications, both sender and receiver must use the same cipher and the same key.
///
/// In order to enable this module you must uncomment #define RH_ENABLE_ENCRYPTION_MODULE at the bottom of RadioHead.h
/// But ensure you have installed the Crypto directory from arduinolibs first:
/// http://rweather.github.io/arduinolibs/index.html
