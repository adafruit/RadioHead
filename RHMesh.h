/// \class RHMesh RHMesh.h <RHMesh.h>
/// \brief RHRouter subclass for sending addressed, optionally acknowledged datagrams
/// multi-hop routed across a network, with automatic route discovery
///
/// Manager class that extends RHRouter to add automatic route discovery within a mesh of adjacent nodes, 
/// and route signalling.
///
/// Unlike RHRouter, RHMesh can be used in networks where the network topology is fluid, or unknown, 
/// or if nodes can mode around or go in or out of service. When a node wants to send a 
/// message to another node, it will automatically discover a route to the destination node and use it. 
/// If the route becomes unavailable, a new route will be discovered.
///
/// \par Route Discovery
///
/// When a RHMesh mesh node is initialised, it doe not know any routes to any other nodes 
/// (see RHRouter for details on route and the routing table).
/// When you attempt to send a message with sendtoWait, will first check to see if there is a route to the 
/// destinastion node in the routing tabl;e. If not, it wil initialite 'Route Discovery'.
/// When a node needs to discover a route to another node, it broadcasts MeshRouteDiscoveryMessage 
/// with a message type of RH_MESH_MESSAGE_TYPE_ROUTE_DISCOVERY_REQUEST. 
/// Any node that receives such a request checks to see if it is a request for a route to itself
/// (in which case it makes a unicast reply to the originating node with a 
/// MeshRouteDiscoveryMessage 
/// with a message type of RH_MESH_MESSAGE_TYPE_ROUTE_DISCOVERY_RESPONSE) 
/// otherwise it rebroadcasts the request, after adding itself to the list of nodes visited so 
/// far by the request.
///
/// If a node receives a RH_MESH_MESSAGE_TYPE_ROUTE_DISCOVERY_REQUEST that already has itself 
/// listed in the visited nodes, it knows it has already seen and rebroadcast this request, 
/// and threfore ignores it. This prevents broadcast storms.
/// When a node receives a RH_MESH_MESSAGE_TYPE_ROUTE_DISCOVERY_REQUEST it can use the list of 
/// nodes aready visited to deduce routes back towards the originating (requesting node). 
/// This also means that when the destination node of the request is reached, it (and all 
/// the previous nodes the request visited) will have a route back to the originating node. 
/// This means the unicast RH_MESH_MESSAGE_TYPE_ROUTE_DISCOVERY_RESPONSE 
/// reply will be routed successfully back to the original route requester.
///
/// The RH_MESH_MESSAGE_TYPE_ROUTE_DISCOVERY_RESPONSE sent back by the destination node contains 
/// the full list of nodes that were visited on the way to the destination.
/// Therefore, intermediate nodes that route the reply back towards the originating node can use the 
/// node list in the reply to deduce routes to all the nodes between it and the destination node.
///
/// Therefore, RH_MESH_MESSAGE_TYPE_ROUTE_DISCOVERY_REQUEST and 
/// RH_MESH_MESSAGE_TYPE_ROUTE_DISCOVERY_RESPONSE together ensure the original requester and all 
/// the intermediate nodes know how to route to the source and destination nodes and every node along the path.
///
/// Note that there is a race condition here that can effect routing on multipath routes. For example, 
/// if the route to the destination can traverse several paths, last reply from the destination 
/// will be the one used.
///
/// \par Route Failure
///
/// RHRouter (and therefore RHMesh) use reliable hop-to-hop delivery of messages using 
/// hop-to-hop acknowledgements, but not end-to-end acknowledgements. When sendtoWait() returns, 
/// you know that the message has been delivered to the next hop, but not if it is (or even if it can be) 
/// delivered to the destination node. If during the course of hop-to-hop routing of a message, 
/// one of the intermediate RHMesh nodes finds it cannot deliver to the next hop 
/// (say due to a lost route or no acknwledgement from the next hop), it replies to the 
/// originator with a unicast MeshRouteFailureMessage RH_MESH_MESSAGE_TYPE_ROUTE_FAILURE message. 
/// Intermediate nodes (on the way beack to the originator)
/// and the originating node use this message to delete the route to the destination 
/// node of the original message. This means that if a route to a destination becomes unusable 
/// (either because an intermediate node is off the air, or has moved out of range) a new route 
/// will be established the next time a message is to be sent.
///
/// \par Message Format
///
/// RHMesh uses a number of message formats layered on top of RHRouter:
/// - MeshApplicationMessage (message type RH_MESH_MESSAGE_TYPE_APPLICATION). 
///   Carries an application layer message for the caller of RHMesh
/// - MeshRouteDiscoveryMessage (message types RH_MESH_MESSAGE_TYPE_ROUTE_DISCOVERY_REQUEST 
///   and RH_MESH_MESSAGE_TYPE_ROUTE_DISCOVERY_RESPONSE). Carries Route Discovery messages 
///   (broadcast) and replies (unicast).
/// - MeshRouteFailureMessage (message type RH_MESH_MESSAGE_TYPE_ROUTE_FAILURE) Informs nodes of 
///   route failures.
///
/// Part of the Arduino RH library for operating with HopeRF RH compatible transceivers 
/// (see http://www.hoperf.com)
///
/// \par Memory
///
/// RHMesh programs require significant amount of SRAM, often approaching 2kbytes, 
/// which is beyond or at the limits of some Arduinos and other processors. Programs 
/// with additional software besides basic RHMesh programs may well require even more. If you have insufficient
/// SRAM for your program, it may result in failure to run, or wierd crashes and other hard to trace behaviour.
/// In this event you should consider a processor with more SRAM, such as the MotienoMEGA with 16k
/// (https://lowpowerlab.com/shop/moteinomega) or others.
///
/// \par Performance
/// This class (in the interests of simple implemtenation and low memory use) does not have
/// message queueing. This means that only one message at a time can be handled. Message transmission 
/// failures can have a severe impact on network performance.
/// If you need high performance mesh networking under all conditions consider XBee or similar.
