/// \class RH_E32 RH_E32.h <RH_E32.h>
/// \brief Driver to send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams via a EBYTE E32-TTL-1W
/// and similar serial radio transceiver.
///
/// Works with
///  E32-TTL-1W
///
/// Note: it should also be possible to use the E32-TTL-1W with the RadioHead RH_Serial module,
/// which will also you to send longer packets, but will require you to use the EBYTE Wireless Module Setting program
/// to configure the radio first. In this arrangement the E32 would act as a transparent serial connection.
/// This has not been tested by us.
///
/// \par Overview
///
/// This class provides basic functions for sending and receiving unaddressed, 
/// unreliable datagrams of arbitrary length to 53 octets per packet.
///
/// Manager classes may use this class to implement reliable, addressed datagrams and streams, 
/// mesh routers, repeaters, translators etc.
///
/// Naturally, for any 2 radios to communicate that must be configured to use the same frequency and 
/// modulation scheme.
///
/// This Driver provides an object-oriented interface for sending and receiving data messages with EBYTE
/// RFM95/96/97/98(W), Semtech SX1276/77/78/7E32-TTL-1W9 and compatible radio modules. These modules implement
/// long range LORA transcivers with a transparent serial interface. With 1W power output the manufacturer
/// claims up to 6km range.
///
/// This Driver provides functions for sending and receiving messages of up
/// to 53 octets on any frequency supported by the radio, in a range of
/// data rates and power outputs. Frequency can be set with
/// 1MHz precision to any frequency from 410 to 441MHz.
///
/// You can use either a hardware or software serial connection.
///
/// Tested with Arduino Uno and software serial.
///
/// \par Packet Format
///
/// All messages sent and received by this Driver conform to this packet format:
///
/// - 5 octets HEADER: (LENGTH,  TO, FROM, ID, FLAGS)
/// - 0 to 53 octets DATA
///
/// \par Connecting E32-TTL-1W to Arduino
///
/// We tested with Arduino Uno. We used SoftwareSerial on pins 6 and 7) to connect to the E32 module, so
/// we could continue to use the only hardware serial port for debugging
/// \code
///                 Arduino      E32
///                 GND----------GND   (ground in)
///                 5V-----------VCC   (5V in)
///             pin D4-----------M0    (mode control pin input to radio)
///             pin D5-----------M1    (mode control pin input to radio)
///             pin D6-----------RXD   (serial data input from Arduino to radio)
///             pin D7-----------TXD   (serial data output from radio to Arduino)
///             pin D8-----------AUX   (Aux pin output from radio to Arduino)
/// \endcode
/// With this connection, you can initialise the serial port and RH_E32 like this:
/// \code
/// SoftwareSerial mySerial(7, 6);
/// RH_E32  driver(&mySerial, 4, 5, 8);
/// \endcode
///
/// For Adafruit M0 Feather:
/// \code
///                 Feather      E32
///                 GND----------GND   (ground in)
///                 3V-----------VCC   (3.3V in)
///             pin D5-----------M0    (mode control pin input to radio)
///             pin D6-----------M1    (mode control pin input to radio)
///             pin D1/Tx--------RXD   (serial data input from M0 to radio)
///             pin D0/Rx--------TXD   (serial data output from radio to M0)
///             pin D9-----------AUX   (Aux pin output from radio to M0)
/// \endcode
/// With this connection, you can initialise serial port 1 and RH_E32 like this:
/// \code
/// RH_E32  driver(&Serial1, 5, 6, 9);
/// \endcode
/// Other connection schems are possible provided the approporiate constructors are used for SoftwareSerial and RH_E32
///
/// \par Memory
///
/// The RH_RF95 driver requires non-trivial amounts of memory. The sample
/// programs all compile to about 8kbytes each, which will fit in the
/// flash proram memory of most Arduinos. However, the RAM requirements are
/// more critical. Therefore, you should be vary sparing with RAM use in
/// programs that use the RH_E32 driver.
///
/// It is often hard to accurately identify when you are hitting RAM limits on Arduino. 
/// The symptoms can include:
/// - Mysterious crashes and restarts
/// - Changes in behaviour when seemingly unrelated changes are made (such as adding print() statements)
/// - Hanging
/// - Output from Serial.print() not appearing
///
/// \par Performance
///
/// This radio supports a range of different data rates and powers.
/// The lowest speeds are the most reliable, however you should note that at 1kbps and with an 13 octet payload,
/// the transmission time for one packet approaches 5 seconds. Therefore you should be cautios about trying to
/// send too many or too long messages per unit of time, lest you monopolise the airwaves.
/// Be a good neighbour and use the lowest power and fastest speed that you can.
///
/// Forward Error Correction (FEC) is always enabled in these radios by RH_E32.
///
/// \par Range
///
/// When running with a power output of 1W and at the slowest speed of 1kbps, this module has an impressive range.
/// We tested with:
///  E32-TTL-1W (1 W power, 1kbps data rate)
///  Single wire antenna with a small meta ground plane at about 1m above ground level
///  Arduino Uno
///  RadioHead RH_E32 module with e32_client and e32_server sketches
///  Packet length 13 octets (total payload 18 octets)
///  (and yes, we have an appropriate radio license for that power output)
///
/// We were able to get reliable reception over 7km (6 km over ocean and 1 km through low rise residential area)
///
/// You can expect less range with lower power outputs and faster speeds.
/// You can expect less range in highrise cities.
/// You can expect more range with directional antennas.
/// You can expect more range with shorter messages.
/// 
/// \par Transmitter Power
///   TBA
///
/// Caution: the maximum power output of this radio (1W = 30dbM) is almost certainly more than the
/// permitted power level for unlicensed users in the ISM bands in most countries. Be sure you comply with your local
/// regulations. Be a good neighbour and use the lowest power and fastest speed that you can.
