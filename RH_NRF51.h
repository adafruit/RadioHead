/// \class RH_NRF51 RH_NRF51.h <RH_NRF51.h>
/// \brief Send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams by nRF51 and nRF52 compatible transceivers.
///
/// Supported transceivers include:
/// - Nordic nRF51 based 2.4GHz radio modules, such as nRF51822 
/// and other compatible chips, such as used in RedBearLabs devices like:
/// http://store.redbearlab.com/products/redbearlab-nrf51822
/// http://store.redbearlab.com/products/blenano
/// and
/// Sparkfun nRF52832 breakout board, with Arduino 1.6.13 and
/// Sparkfun nRF52 boards manager 0.2.3
///
/// This base class provides basic functions for sending and receiving unaddressed, unreliable datagrams
/// of arbitrary length to 254 octets per packet. Use one of the Manager classes to get addressing and 
/// acknowledgement reliability, routing, meshes etc.
///
/// The nRF51822 (https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-Smart-Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF51822)
/// and nRF52832 (https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/nrf52832-breakout-board-hookup-guide)
/// is a complete SoC (system on a chip) with ARM microprocessor and 2.4 GHz radio, which supports a range of channels 
/// and transmission bit rates. Chip antenna is on-board.
///
/// This library provides functions for sending and receiving messages of up to 254 octets on any 
/// frequency supported by the nRF51822/nRF52832, at a selected data rate.
///
/// The nRF51 transceiver is configured to use Enhanced Shockburst with no acknowledgement and no retransmits.
/// TXADDRESS and RXADDRESSES:RXADDR0 (ie pipe 0) are the logical address used. The on-air network address
/// is set in BASE0 and PREFIX0. SHORTS is used to automatically transition the radio between Ready, Start and Disable.
/// No interrupts are used.
///
/// Naturally, for any 2 radios to communicate that must be configured to use the same frequency and 
/// data rate, and with identical network addresses.
///
/// Example programs are included to show the main modes of use.
///
/// \par Packet Format
///
/// All messages sent and received by this class conform to this packet format. It is NOT compatible
/// with the one used by RH_NRF24 and the nRF24L01 product specification, mainly because the nRF24 only supports
/// 6 bits of message length.
///
/// - 1 octets PREAMBLE
/// - 3 to 5 octets NETWORK ADDRESS
/// - 1 octet S0 (not used, required if encryption used)
/// - 8 bits PAYLOAD LENGTH
/// - 1 octet S1 (not used, required if encryption used)
/// - 0 to 251 octets PAYLOAD (possibly encrypted), consisting of:
///   - 1 octet TO header
///   - 1 octet FROM header
///   - 1 octet ID header
///   - 1 octet FLAGS header
///   - 0 to 247 octets of user message
/// - 2 octets CRC (Algorithm x^16+x^12^x^5+1 with initial value 0xFFFF).
///
/// \par Example programs
///
/// Several example programs are provided.
///
/// The sample programs are designed to be built using Arduino 1.6.4 or later using the procedures outlined
/// in http://redbearlab.com/getting-started-nrf51822/
/// or with Sparkfun nRF52832 breakout board, with Arduino 1.6.13 and
/// Sparkfun nRF52 boards manager 0.2.3 using the procedures outlined in
/// https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/nrf52832-breakout-board-hookup-guide
///
/// \par Radio Performance
///
/// At DataRate2Mbps (2Mb/s), payload length vs airtime:
/// 0 bytes takes about 70us, 128 bytes takes 520us, 254 bytes take 1020us.
/// You can extrapolate linearly to slower data rates.
///
/// The RF powers claimed by the chip manufacturer have not been independently verified here.
///
/// \par Memory
///
/// The compiled client and server sketches are about 42k bytes on Arduino. 
/// The reliable client and server sketches compile to about 43k bytes on Arduino. Unfortunately the 
/// Arduino build environmnet does not drop unused clsses and code, so the resulting programs include
/// all the unused classes ad code. This needs to be revisited.
/// RAM requirements are minimal.
