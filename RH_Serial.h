/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// \class RH_Serial RH_Serial.h <RH_Serial.h>
/// \brief Driver to send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams via a serial connection
///
/// This class sends and received packetized messages over a serial connection.
/// It can be used for point-to-point or multidrop, RS232, RS488 or other serial connections as
/// supported by your controller hardware.
/// It can also be used to communicate via radios with serial interfaces such as:
/// - APC220 Radio Data Module http://www.dfrobot.com/image/data/TEL0005/APC220_Datasheet.pdf
///   http://www.dfrobot.com/image/data/TEL0005/APC220_Datasheet.pdf
/// - 3DR Telemetry Radio https://store.3drobotics.com/products/3dr-radio
/// - HopeRF HM-TR module http://www.hoperf.com/upload/rf_app/HM-TRS.pdf
/// - Others
///
/// Compiles and runs on Linux, OSX and all the microprocessers and MCUs suported by
/// radiohead. On Linux and OSX, a RadioHead specific version of HardwareSerial (in RHutil/HardwareSerial.*)
/// encapsulates access to any serial port (or suported USB-serial converter)
///
/// The packetised messages include message encapsulation, headers, a message payload and a checksum.
/// It therefore can support robust binary message passing with error-detection and retransmission
/// when used with the appropriate manager. This allows reliable serial communicaitons even over very long
/// lines where noise might otherwise affect reliablity of the communications.
///
/// \par Packet Format
///
/// All messages sent and received by this RH_Serial Driver conform to this packet format:
/// \code
/// DLE 
/// STX
/// TO Header                (1 octet)
/// FROM Header              (1 octet)
/// ID Header                (1 octet)
/// FLAGS Header             (1 octet)
/// Message payload          (0 to 60 octets)
/// DLE
/// ETX
/// Frame Check Sequence FCS CCITT CRC-16 (2 octets)
/// \endcode
///
/// If any of octets from TO header through to the end of the payload are a DLE, 
/// then they are preceded by a DLE (ie DLE stuffing).
/// The FCS covers everything from the TO header to the ETX inclusive, but not any stuffed DLEs
///
/// \par Physical connection
///
/// The physical connection to your serial port will depend on the type of platform you are on.
///
/// For example, many arduinos only support a single Serial port on pins 0 and 1, 
/// which is shared with the USB host connections. On such Arduinos, it is not possible to use both 
/// RH_Serial on the Serial port as well as using the Serial port for debugand other printing or communications.
/// 
/// On Arduino Mega and Due, there are 4 serial ports:
/// - Serial: this is the serial port connected to the USB interface and the programming host.
/// - Serial1: on pins 18 (Tx) and 19 (Rx)
/// - Serial2: on pins 16 (Tx) and 17 (Rx)
/// - Serial3: on pins 14 (Tx) and 15 (Rx)
///
/// On Uno32, there are 2 serial ports:
/// - SerialUSB: this is the port for the USB host connection.
/// - Serial1: on pins 39 (Rx) and 40 (Tx) 
///
/// On Maple and Flymaple, there are 4 serial ports:
/// - SerialUSB: this is the port for the USB host connection.
/// - Serial1: on pins 7 (Tx) and 8 (Rx)
/// - Serial2: on pins 0 (Rx) and 1 (Tx)
/// - Serial3: on pins 29 (Tx) and 30 (Rx)
///
/// On Linux and OSX there can be any number of serial ports.
/// - On Linux, names like /dev/ttyUSB0 (for a FTDO USB-serial converter)
/// - On OSX, names like /dev/tty.usbserial-A501YSWL (for a FTDO USB-serial converter)
///
/// Note that it is necessary for you to select which Serial port your RF_Serial will use and pass it to the 
/// contructor. On Linux you must pass an instance of HardwareSerial.
///
/// \par Testing
/// 
/// You can test this class and the RHReliableDatagram manager
/// on Unix and OSX with back-to-back connected FTDI USB-serial adapters.
/// Back-to-back means the TX of one is connected to the RX of the other and vice-versa. 
/// You should also join the ground pins.
///
/// Assume the 2 USB-serial adapters are connected by USB
/// and have been assigned device names: 
/// /dev/ttyUSB0 and /dev/ttyUSB1.
/// Build the example RHReliableDatagram client and server programs:
/// \code
/// tools/simBuild examples/serial/serial_reliable_datagram_server/serial_reliable_datagram_server.pde 
/// tools/simBuild examples/serial/serial_reliable_datagram_client/serial_reliable_datagram_client.pde
/// \endcode
/// In one window run the server, specifying the device to use as an environment variable:
/// \code
/// RH_HARDWARESERIAL_DEVICE_NAME=/dev/ttyUSB1 ./serial_reliable_datagram_server 
/// \endcode
/// And in another window run the client, specifying the other device to use as an environment variable:
/// \code
/// RH_HARDWARESERIAL_DEVICE_NAME=/dev/ttyUSB0 ./serial_reliable_datagram_client 
/// \endcode
/// You should see the 2 programs passing messages to each other.
