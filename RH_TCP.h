/// \class RH_TCP RH_TCP.h <RH_TCP.h>
/// \brief Driver to send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams via sockets on a Linux simulator
///
/// \par Overview
///
/// This class is intended to support the testing of RadioHead manager classes and simulated sketches 
/// on a Linux host.
/// RH_TCP class sends messages to and from other simulator sketches via sockets to a 'Luminiferous Ether' 
/// simulator server (provided).
/// Multiple instances of simulated clients and servers can run on a single Linux server,
/// passing messages to each other via the etherSimulator.pl server.
///
/// Simple RadioHead sketches can be compiled and run on Linux using a build script and some support files.
///
/// \par Running simulated sketches
///
/// \code
/// cd whatever/RadioHead 
/// # build the client for Linux:
/// tools/simBuild examples/simulator/simulator_reliable_datagram_client/simulator_reliable_datagram_client.pde
/// # build the server for Linux:
/// tools/simBuild examples/simulator/simulator_reliable_datagram_server/simulator_reliable_datagram_server.pde
/// # in one window, run the simulator server:
/// tools/etherSimulator.pl
/// # in another window, run the server
/// ./simulator_reliable_datagram_server 
/// # in another window, run the client:
/// ./simulator_reliable_datagram_client
/// # see output:
/// Sending to simulator_reliable_datagram_server
/// got reply from : 0x02: And hello back to you
/// Sending to simulator_reliable_datagram_server
/// got reply from : 0x02: And hello back to you
/// Sending to simulator_reliable_datagram_server
/// got reply from : 0x02: And hello back to you
/// ...
/// \endcode
///
/// You can change the listen port and the simulated baud rate with 
/// command line arguments passed to etherSimulator.pl
///
/// \par Implementation
///
/// etherServer.pl is a conventional server written in Perl.
/// listens on a TCP socket (defaults to port 4000) for connections from sketch simulators
/// using RH_TCP as theur driver.
/// The simulated sketches send messages out to the 'ether' over the TCP connection to the etherServer.
/// etherServer manages the delivery of each message to any other RH_TCP sketches that are running.
///
/// \par Prerequisites
///
/// g++ compiler installed and in your $PATH
/// Perl
/// Perl POE library
///
